# Company-Global-Sales-Analysis
E-Youth Project

In this project, we aim to answer several key business questions to evaluate the company’s overall performance. By exploring and analyzing the data, we identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement that impact profitability.

The insights gained from this analysis help us assess how well the company is performing and provide data-driven recommendations to support better decision-making and improve the company’s profitability moving forward.
